# C#-Unity-Game---FlyRush-3D
An interesting 3D game project where I learnt 3D modelling in blender, importing them into Unity and making all of them work together with C#

FlyRush 3D is a platformer unity 3D game where the player can fly through endless terrain levels with 11 different character combinations. The goal is to dodge obstacles and to gain as much as coins and diamonds and finish the level

Tech stack Used: Google Android SDK, Unity Engine, Blender for 3D models

# Whats new with flyRush

Nothing, actually. I wanted to make an addictive game which also contributed to some learning experience with c# and unity. And I was able to achieve that goal within 3 months from scratch
FlyRush 3D has 5 different maps such as golf course, mountain range, Ice land, Futuristic city and Desert land

# Theres around 11 3D modelled characters for the game
Flyrush 3D has a few nice characters such as DJI Drone, UFO, Avatar's Glider, Helicopter each animated by myself with Unity Keyframing tech
